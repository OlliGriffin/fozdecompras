After the car gets to around 10 miles each hour, the engine keeps it moving.

2. Series hybrid cars - With these automobiles, all the work is performed by the electric electric motor. In addition, the gasoline engine just keeps the electric battery charged and it is not generally linked to the wheels.

3. Series-parallel hybrid cars - What's great about these vehicles is normally their computer can signal the electric electric motor or gas engine to work exclusively. They are able to also work jointly to meet up what the driver needs.
